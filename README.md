Ansible Playbook for Oracle Runtime Client (v12.2.0)
====================================================

Requirements
------------

There aren't many requirements. Currently the scripts are only tested on following environments:
* CentOS 7 or RHEL 7 (x86_64)
* CentOS 6 or RHEL 6 (x86_64)
* Ansible 2.5

I worked for the dependencies only with the yum_module so far. On other distributions this role may need some extension.
